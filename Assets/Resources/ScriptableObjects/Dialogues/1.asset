  - <Text>k__BackingField: No one rejects, dislikes or avoids pleasure itself, because
      it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
      encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone
      who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain,
      but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him
      some great pleasure.
